    "  > A lot of algorithms involving heaps can be considered greedy. A heap gives us a maximum or minimum element, and generally greedy approaches will be **choosing max/min at each step**.\n",

    "  > Many greedy problems need to **sort the input at the start**. Again, this is because we want to greedily choose the max/min elements in many problems, and sorting the input makes this convenient.\n",
